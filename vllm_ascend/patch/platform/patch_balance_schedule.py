"""Balance scheduling patch.

Keeps running-request counts even across DP ranks: every step an all-gather
of each rank's ``len(running)`` runs once via ``BalanceScheduler.balance_gather``
(invoked from the engine core, NOT from inside ``schedule()``); if any rank
was at the running cap at the end of the previous step, every rank stops
admitting new WAITING requests (``any-rank-at-cap => global freeze``). Each
rank reaches that decision independently from the same gathered snapshot --
there is no leader. See ``docs/.../balance_schedule_refactor.md`` for the
design.

The ``schedule()`` body is a verbatim copy of the **v0.24.0** release tag's
``Scheduler.schedule()`` (the production pin), plus exactly three balance
deltas: (1) the disabled-path early return that delegates to ``super()``,
(2) the ``balance_flag`` break inside the WAITING loop
(``any-rank-at-cap => global freeze``), and (3) ``if request_queue is None:
break`` in place of upstream's ``assert request_queue is not None`` (so a
drained-rank schedule does not assert when balance defers admission). Both
supported vLLM refs expose ``schedule(throttle_prefills=False)``, so the
disabled fast path forwards that argument directly.

The engine-core side is NOT copied: ``BalanceDPEngineCoreProc`` hooks
``_has_global_unfinished_reqs`` (called every iteration by upstream's
``run_busy_loop`` on every non-idle path) to inject the DP group and run
``balance_gather`` once per step. The gather lives in the engine core, NOT
inside ``schedule()``: a rank that has drained its local requests never enters
``schedule()`` (it runs a dummy batch instead), so an ``all_gather`` in
``schedule()`` would be skipped by that rank while busy ranks call it -- a
collective mismatch that deadlocks.

The gather is hooked IMMEDIATELY AFTER ``super()._has_global_unfinished_reqs()``
(not inside ``_process_engine_step``). ``_has_global_unfinished_reqs`` is
itself a cross-rank collective (an all-reduce every 32 steps internally) and is
the only point in the busy loop that re-synchronizes ranks on wave/idle state.
Hooking gather right after it keeps the every-step all-gather in the same
lock-stepped region, so ranks enter the gather having just agreed on
``engines_running``. Hooking it earlier -- inside ``_process_engine_step``,
before that sync and before the idle ``continue`` gate -- decouples the gather
from the synchronization: at wave boundaries one rank can reach the gather
while another is still blocked in ``_process_input_queue`` or
``future.result()``, deadlocking the all-gather. The stuck EngineCore then
can't drain its worker shm channel, the worker's ``sample_tokens`` response
has nowhere to land, and after 60s the engine dies with
``RPC call to sample_tokens timed out``. ``_has_global_unfinished_reqs`` is
only called on iterations that did NOT take the idle ``continue``, so gather
is skipped consistently by every rank when all are idle -- no rank does an
extra gather.

The engine core class is swapped via the module-level ``DPEngineCoreProc``
reference. This works ONLY because upstream's ``run_engine_core`` resolves
that name at call time rather than binding it at import -- if upstream ever
switches to an import-time binding the swap silently stops taking effect, so
the call-time lookup is a load-bearing assumption. The swap is done ONLY when
balance scheduling is enabled (conditional activation, so balance does not
touch configs that don't use it, e.g. PD-disaggregated recompute).

    """Minimal DP engine core hook for balance scheduling.

    The only thing balance scheduling needs from the engine core is the DP
    process group, which the scheduler uses for its per-step all-gather. The
    group is created in ``_init_data_parallel`` (during ``__init__``, before
    the scheduler exists) and the scheduler is created in ``EngineCore.__init__``,
    so both are present by the time the busy loop runs.

    The per-step gather is hooked via ``_has_global_unfinished_reqs`` (called
    every iteration by upstream's ``run_busy_loop`` on every non-idle path),
    NOT from inside ``schedule()``: a rank that has drained its local requests
    never enters ``schedule()`` (it runs a dummy batch instead), so an
    ``all_gather`` living in ``schedule()`` would be skipped by that rank while
    busy ranks call it -- a collective mismatch that deadlocks.

    Why ``_has_global_unfinished_reqs`` and not ``_process_engine_step``:
    ``_has_global_unfinished_reqs`` is itself a cross-rank collective (an
    all-reduce every 32 steps internally) and is the only point in the busy
    loop that re-synchronizes ranks on wave/idle state. Hooking the gather
    immediately after ``super()._has_global_unfinished_reqs()`` keeps the
    every-step all-gather in the same lock-stepped region, so ranks enter the
    gather having just agreed on ``engines_running``. Hooking it earlier --
    inside ``_process_engine_step``, before that sync and before the idle
    ``continue`` gate -- decouples the gather from the synchronization: at
    wave boundaries one rank can reach the gather while another is still
    blocked in ``_process_input_queue`` or ``future.result()``, deadlocking
    the all-gather. The stuck EngineCore then can't drain its worker shm
    channel, the worker's ``sample_tokens`` response has nowhere to land, and
    after 60s the engine dies with ``RPC call to sample_tokens timed out``.
    Because ``_has_global_unfinished_reqs`` is only called on iterations that
    did NOT take the idle ``continue``, gather is skipped consistently by
    every rank when all are idle -- no rank does an extra gather. This matches
    the pre-refactor copied ``run_busy_loop``, where gather sat right after
    the all-reduce (after schedule + execute + update_from_output).
