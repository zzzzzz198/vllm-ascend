"""Single source of truth for the ``@pytest.mark.e2e_coverage`` taxonomy.

This module defines the allowed dimensions and their legal values exactly
once. Three consumers import from here so they never drift apart:

- ``tests/e2e/generate_coverage_html.py`` — renders the coverage report and
  its taxonomy-driven HTML (filter options, bar charts, explorer).
- ``tests/e2e/conftest.py`` — enforces valid marker values at pytest
  collection time (``pytest_collection_modifyitems``).
- ``.github/workflows/scripts/coverage.py`` — CI gate that fails the LINT job
  when a marked test carries an out-of-taxonomy value.

Adding a new value: append it to the relevant set in :data:`ALLOWED_VALUES`.
That is the only edit needed — generators, runtime checks and CI all pick it
up automatically.

Multi-value dimensions (``feature``, ``parallel``) accept a comma-separated
string, e.g. ``feature="lora,mtp"``. Each comma-separated token must itself
be a member of the dimension's allowed set; see :func:`split_multi` and
:func:`validate_coverage_marker`.
