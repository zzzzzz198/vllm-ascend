- **PyTorch / torch_npu**: 2.10.0 / 2.10.0.post2.
- **Triton Ascend**: 3.2.1.
- **Mooncake**: 0.3.11.post1 in the release images.

### Ready to Deprecate

The following features and optimizations are planned for deprecation in a future release:

- Layer sharding.
- FlashComm2.
- The FlashComm3 multistream-overlap gate.
- Hamming sparse.
- Asynchronous exponential overlap.
- Matmul all-reduce and matmul all-reduce RMSNorm fusions.
- Weight prefetch.
- Dynamic-batch SLO.
- KV offload in KV Pool.
- Fused MC2 mode 2 (`enable_fused_mc2=2`).

### Known Issues

- The combination of pipeline parallelism (PP) and prefill context parallelism (PCP) is not supported in v0.23.0. Support for this combination is deferred to a later release.
- The former `enable_sparse_c8` option has been split into `enable_sparse_sfa_c8` and `enable_sparse_li_c8`. Existing `--additional-config` settings must use one or both new options depending on whether Sparse Flash Attention C8, LightningIndexer C8, or both are required. [#12351](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/12351)
- The load-balance proxy can swallow decode errors and return an empty HTTP 200 response. [#12166](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/12166)
- Qwen3-30B-A3B floating-point serving can show a 1-2 ms TPOT regression at batch size 1 in the reported TP4 full-graph configuration. [#12337](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/12337)
- In the reported DeepSeek V4 Flash W8A8 MTP P/D-disaggregated deployment, the second aisbench round can cause a worker process from another card to appear on an NPU device. [#12338](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/12338)
- On Ascend 950, Qwen3.5-397B-W8A8-MXFP8-FULL_QUANT in a P/D-disaggregated deployment without MTP can alternate between correct and incorrect outputs. [#12339](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/12339)
- DeepSeek V4 Pro on A3 and A5 can show continuously increasing memory usage in both P/D-disaggregated and co-located deployments, eventually causing OOM or service instability. [#12345](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/12345)
- DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus can show about a 15% output-throughput regression against the reported v0.18.0 baseline in high-throughput P/D-disaggregated deployments; the regression was reported on an A3 four-node 2P1D setup and an A2 large-EP setup. [#12349](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/12349)
- KV-cache transfer can produce precision issues and TP-shard inconsistencies when reformatting occurs before all pull tasks for a request have completed. [#12359](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/12359)

### Dependencies

- **Python**: Python 3.12 is now officially supported and the default for all Docker images. Python 3.10 and 3.11 remain supported. [#9558](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9558)
- **Upstream vLLM**: Upgraded from v0.20.2 to v0.21.0. [#9835](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9835)
- **xlite**: Upgraded from `0.1.0rc9.dev210` to `0.1.0rc10.dev210`.
- **CANN**: 9.0.0 for A2/A3/Ascend 950 (unchanged from v0.20.2rc1); **310P uses CANN 9.1.0 beta**. **Note**: `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` requires HDK 25.5.1+ / CANN 8.5.0+ for the stream-budget fix; older stacks are still limited by the legacy stream budget and may fall back to `PIECEWISE`.
- **PyTorch / torch_npu**: 2.10.0 (unchanged from v0.20.2rc1).
- **triton-ascend**: 3.2.1 (unchanged from v0.20.2rc1).
- **Mooncake**: Upgraded from v0.3.8.post1 to v0.3.9. [#10339](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/10339)

### Breaking Changes and Migration Notes

- **`VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_CONTEXT_PARALLEL` Removed**: The environment variable `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_CONTEXT_PARALLEL` has been removed as part of the migration to `AscendConfig`. Users should migrate any remaining uses to the equivalent AscendConfig option. [#9668](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9668)
- **DSA-CP Configuration Decoupling**: DSA-CP is now controlled via `additional_config.enable_dsa_cp`, decoupled from the FlashComm1 switch. Users who previously relied on FC1 implicitly enabling DSA-CP must now explicitly set both `enable_flashcomm1` and `enable_dsa_cp`. [#9697](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9697) [#9910](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9910)
- **Python 3.12 in Docker Images**: All Docker base images now use Python 3.12 (`py3.12`). If your deployment or custom images depend on `py3.11`, update your image tags accordingly. [#9558](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9558)

### Documentation

- Refreshed and optimized documentation for the current development branch. [#9606](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9606)
- Updated model-code converter writing guide. [#9881](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9881)
- Added DSA-CP configuration documentation for DeepSeek V3.2 and GLM5. [#9910](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9910)
- Added Ascend 950 disaggregated PD endpoint configuration documentation. [#9690](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9690)

### Known Issues

- **FULL_AND_PIECEWISE on older HDK/CANN**: HDK < 25.5.1 / CANN < 8.5.0 stacks still have the old stream-budget limitation, which may cause graph capture failures or fallback to `PIECEWISE` mode. Upgrade to HDK 25.5.1+ / CANN 8.5.0+ is recommended for full `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` support.
- GLM5/GLM5.1 W4A8 deployments have known issues in some advanced configurations. CANN 9.0 with MC2 can return inaccurate output, FlashComm can fail during model startup, and MTP weight loading can fail in 1P1D A3 deployments. [#9395](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/9395) [#9658](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/9658) [#9655](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/9655)
- GLM-5.1 deployments can hit `MoeDistributeDispatchV2`/NPU graph failures when Expert Parallel is used together with FULL graph mode. The reported workaround is to disable Expert Parallel for FULL graph mode, or use PIECEWISE/eager mode. [#9503](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/9503)
- Qwen3.6-35B-A3B may shut down when MTP/speculative decoding is enabled, with `numAcceptedTokens[0]=4 exceeds varlen segment length=3` reported during shape/dtype processing. [#9956](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/9956)
- GLM-5.1 can hang on the P node in 200K long-sequence 1P1D agent workloads after long-running service, with `MoeDistributeDispatchV2`/`aclnnMoeDistributeDispatchV4` reporting an AICore timeout. [#9958](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/9958)
- GLM5 W4A8 deployments can see a significantly lower speculative decoding acceptance rate when MTP3 is used together with FlashComm. [#9803](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/9803)
- **DeepSeek-V4 KV Pool**: When enabling KV Pool for DeepSeek-V4, the `--no-disable-hybrid-kv-cache-manager` flag must be added, otherwise the service will OOM at startup. Additionally, KV Pool for DSv4 stores all states for all compression ratio families — storing a sequence of 1M tokens takes approximately 300GB, which is the same behavior as upstream vLLM. [#9975](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/9975)

## v0.20.2rc1 - 2026.06.03

- Reused DSA `topk_indices` across decode steps with IndexCache to reduce repeated DeepSeek V4 index computation. [#9390](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9390)
- Fixed the missing enablement for `cv_indexer_qkv_prepare` multistream parallelism in the new overlap path. [#9530](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9530)
- Reduced host-device synchronization overhead by removing the sync point in PIECEWISE mode. [#9025](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9025)
- Optimized shared expert overlap timing in FusedMoE. [#9413](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9413)
- [Experimental] Added reduce sampling with `enable_reduce_sample` to lower Tensor Parallel communication overhead in distributed greedy, top-k/top-p, and rejection sampling paths. [#8308](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/8308)

### Stability and Bug Fixes

### Known Issue

- Currently, `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_FUSED_MC2` is not recommended for multi-DP and large number of tokens case(`kv_producer` or `kv_both`), this case may create large number of padded tokens across dp, which will be routed to certain experts, and make certain ranks receive tokens overload, resulting accuracy and performance issues. [#8320](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/8320)
- Currently, EPLB cannot support `minimax_m2` model and W4A8 quantization. [#8341](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/8341)
- PCP and eagle3 overlaying may generate error when a prefill req's scheduled token number is smaller than `1 + num_speculative_tokens`, which will make this prefill req be treated as a decode req, resulting in an error. [#8402](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/8402)
- NPU soft partitioning + `CUDAGraphMode.PIECEWISE` is not supported. [#8585](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/8585)

- triton-ascend may fail to compile with a g++ internal compiler error (Segmentation fault). Workaround: update to `triton-ascend==3.2.0.dev20260322` and clear the Triton cache (`rm -rf ~/.triton/cache/*`). [#7782](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/7782)
- FIA does not support all MHA head dimensions when using tp-size >= 16 on Ascend. Affected models will fail with an error on unsupported head dimensions. This will be resolved in a future release when FIA supports more head dimensions. [#7729](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/7729)
- While Minimax-2.5 now supports PD Disaggregation, internal testing has identified a 13% regression on the GPQA benchmark when this feature is enabled. We currently do not recommend enabling PD Disaggregation for this model and We are working on an optimization fix.
