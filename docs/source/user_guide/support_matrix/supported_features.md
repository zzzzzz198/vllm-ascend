# Supported Features

The feature support principle of vLLM Ascend is: **aligned with vLLM**. We are also actively collaborating with the community to accelerate support.

Tool calling: [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/tool_calling/)

You can check the [support status of vLLM V1 Engine][v1_user_guide]. Below is the feature support status of vLLM Ascend:
