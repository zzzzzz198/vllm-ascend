# Graph Mode Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how graph mode is used in vLLM Ascend.

vLLM already provides the generic graph-mode architecture, mode definitions, and compile integration. For those upstream concepts, see:

- [CUDA Graphs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/design/cuda_graphs/)
- [torch.compile](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/design/torch_compile/)

This document focuses on the Ascend-specific view: how graph mode works on Ascend, which components are involved, how to configure them, and what constraints users should keep in mind.

## Current Status on Ascend

- Graph mode is currently available only on the **V1 Engine**.
- **ACLGraph** (capture/replay via `torch.npu.NPUGraph`) is the runtime graph execution mechanism used by the default graph path on Ascend.
- **Npugraph_ex** is a compile-time FX graph optimization layer, enabled by default in FULL/FULL_DECODE_ONLY modes. It optimizes the graph before ACLGraph captures it.
- **XliteGraph** is an optional graph path for selected model families and environments.
- In context parallel scenarios, `cudagraph_mode="FULL"` is not sufficiently supported yet.

## Graph Paths on Ascend

vLLM Ascend provides two graph paths:

| Graph Path | Default | Description | Since |
|---|---|---|---|
| ACLGraph (+ Npugraph_ex) | Yes | Compile-time FX optimization (Npugraph_ex) + runtime capture/replay (ACLGraph) | v0.9.0rc1 (Npugraph_ex since v0.15.0rc1) |
| XliteGraph | No | Preconfigured graph path for selected model families. Requires separate installation | v0.11.0 |

## How Graph Mode Works on Ascend

The default graph path on Ascend involves two stages: **compile-time optimization** and **runtime capture/replay**. ACLGraph handles the runtime capture/replay. The compile-time stage differs by `cudagraph_mode`:

- **FULL_AND_PIECEWISE**: Default mode, same as the upstream vLLM strategy. The compile-time path follows PIECEWISE compilation, while the runtime may still use full-graph behavior for uniform decode batches.
- **FULL / FULL_DECODE_ONLY**: Npugraph_ex optimizes the FX graph via npugraph_ex (`force_eager=True`, compile-time only, no capture). The optimized callable is then captured and replayed by ACLGraph at runtime.
- **PIECEWISE**: Npugraph_ex is disabled. Only basic FX fusion passes are applied at compile-time. ACLGraph captures and replays the resulting callable at runtime.
- **NONE**: No compilation or graph capture. The model runs in eager mode.

| `cudagraph_mode` | Compile-time | Runtime | Npugraph_ex |
|---|---|---|---|
| FULL_AND_PIECEWISE | Piecewise compilation path | Mixed: PIECEWISE for mixed batches, FULL-capable for uniform decode batches | Disabled |
| FULL / FULL_DECODE_ONLY | Npugraph_ex FX optimization | ACLGraph capture/replay | Enabled |
| PIECEWISE | Fusion pass only | ACLGraph capture/replay | Disabled |
| NONE | None | Eager execution | Disabled |

Additionally, **XliteGraph** is available as an optional alternative graph path for selected model families (see [Using XliteGraph](#using-xlitegraph)).

## Using ACLGraph

ACLGraph is the runtime graph capture/replay mechanism on Ascend. It is enabled automatically when graph mode is active (i.e., `cudagraph_mode` is not `NONE`), and does not require explicit configuration.

### Basic usage

Offline example:

```python
from vllm import LLM

llm = LLM(model="path/to/Qwen3-0.6B")
outputs = llm.generate("Hello, how are you?")
```

Online example:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```

### Explicit `cudagraph_mode` configuration

The generic `cudagraph_mode` options come from upstream vLLM. On Ascend, the final effective mode may still be adjusted according to platform and backend support, so the official vLLM CUDA Graphs document remains the canonical reference for mode semantics.

CLI example:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --compilation-config '{"cudagraph_mode": "PIECEWISE"}'
```

Python example:

```python
from vllm import LLM

llm = LLM(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    compilation_config={"cudagraph_mode": "PIECEWISE"},
)
```

For the detailed meaning of `NONE`, `PIECEWISE`, `FULL`, `FULL_DECODE_ONLY`, and `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`, as well as the generic fallback policy, see the upstream [CUDA Graphs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/design/cuda_graphs/) design doc.

### Attention backend compatibility

Not all attention backends support all graph modes. vLLM checks attention backend compatibility during compatibility checks and, when possible, automatically adjusts `cudagraph_mode` to a more compatible mode instead of failing immediately. In practice, this means a requested full-graph mode may be narrowed to a mixed or piecewise mode, and if the backend cannot support graph execution at all, graph mode may be disabled.

On Ascend, the current attention backend support levels are:

| Attention backend | Declared support | Practical meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `attention_v1` | `ALWAYS` | Supports graph execution for mixed prefill/decode batches |
| `context_parallel/attention_cp` | `ALWAYS` | Supports graph execution for mixed prefill/decode batches |
| `mla_v1` | `UNIFORM_BATCH` | Graph execution is limited to uniform batches; full graph is more restricted |
| `context_parallel/mla_cp` | `UNIFORM_BATCH` | Graph execution is limited to uniform batches; full graph is more restricted |
| `sfa_v1` | `UNIFORM_BATCH` | Graph execution is limited to uniform batches; full graph is more restricted |
| `context_parallel/sfa_cp` | `UNIFORM_BATCH` | Graph execution is limited to uniform batches; full graph is more restricted |

This is why the effective graph mode on Ascend may differ from the mode requested in configuration.

### Troubleshooting capture resource exhaustion

If ACLGraph capture fails because the configured graph sizes exceed the runtime resources available on the current stack, vLLM Ascend now raises a dedicated error with mitigation guidance. In practice, the most useful actions are:

- upgrade to a newer HDK/CANN stack if one is available;
- reduce `cudagraph_capture_sizes` or `max_cudagraph_capture_size`;
- prefer `FULL` or `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` when the workload is mostly uniform decode;
- temporarily disable graph mode to confirm the issue is capture-related.

This is most likely to appear in `PIECEWISE` or `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` configurations because those paths tend to capture more graphs than uniform full-graph decode.

## Using Npugraph_ex

As introduced in the [RFC](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/4715), Npugraph_ex is a compile-time FX graph optimization layer that works together with ACLGraph. It optimizes the model's FX graph before ACLGraph captures it at runtime. Its performance benefits mainly come from fusing multiple operators into single kernels (e.g., add + rms_norm → npu_add_rms_norm) to reduce kernel launch overhead.

!!! note "Atlas 300I DUO"

    Atlas 300I DUO and Atlas 200I Pro do not support `enable_npugraph_ex`. Set --additional-config '{"ascend_compilation_config": {"enable_npugraph_ex":false}}'.

### Default behavior

Npugraph_ex is **enabled by default** when `cudagraph_mode` is `FULL` or `FULL_DECODE_ONLY`. It is automatically disabled in `PIECEWISE` or `NONE` modes.

This means for most users, Npugraph_ex is active without any explicit configuration:

```python
from vllm import LLM

# Npugraph_ex is enabled by default in FULL/FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode
llm = LLM(model="path/to/Qwen2-7B-Instruct")
outputs = llm.generate("Hello, how are you?")
```

### Explicit configuration

To explicitly control Npugraph_ex:

Offline example:

```python
from vllm import LLM

model = LLM(
    model="path/to/Qwen2-7B-Instruct",
    additional_config={
        "ascend_compilation_config": {
            "enable_npugraph_ex": True,
        }
    }
)
outputs = model.generate("Hello, how are you?")
```

Online example:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct \
  --additional-config '{"ascend_compilation_config":{"enable_npugraph_ex":true}}'
```

To disable Npugraph_ex explicitly:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct \
  --additional-config '{"ascend_compilation_config":{"enable_npugraph_ex":false}}'
```

### Static kernel compilation

Static kernel compilation is an **optional** feature that pre-compiles operator binaries with fixed shapes at compile time, reducing runtime overhead for networks with static or near-static shapes. It is **disabled by default** and must be explicitly enabled.

!!! note

    Enabling static kernel triggers a compilation pass during the graph capture phase at service startup. This may add **several minutes to tens of minutes** to the startup time depending on the number of operators to compile and model complexity. Once completed, subsequent request processing is not affected.

Offline example:

```python
from vllm import LLM

model = LLM(
    model="path/to/Qwen2-7B-Instruct",
    additional_config={
        "ascend_compilation_config": {
            "enable_npugraph_ex": True,
            "enable_static_kernel": True,
        }
    }
)
outputs = model.generate("Hello, how are you?")
```

Online example:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct \
  --additional-config '{"ascend_compilation_config":{"enable_npugraph_ex":true, "enable_static_kernel":true}}'
```

#### Verifying static kernel is active

The recommended way to verify static kernel is in effect is through **Ascend Profiling**:

1. Collect a profiling trace of your running model using [Ascend PyTorch Profiler](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/Pytorch/2600/apiref/torchnpuCustomsapi/docs/zh/custom_APIs/torch_npu-profiler/torch_npu-profiler-profile.md) (`torch_npu.profiler`).
2. Open the generated `op_statistic.csv` file.
3. Look for operators whose `op_type` or `name` column contains the keyword **`static_kernel`**. If such entries exist, static kernel compilation has taken effect for those operators.

During the compilation phase, you will see a Python warning (visible by default):

```text
Starting static kernel compilation, the build directory is <path>
```

This confirms that compilation has been triggered. The absence of this message means static kernel was not enabled or the cached result was reused directly.

For more details about Npugraph_ex, see the [npugraph_ex guide](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/Pytorch/2600/modthirdparty/torchairuseguide/docs/zh/overview.md).

## Using XliteGraph {: #using-xlitegraph }

XliteGraph is an optional graph path for the Llama and Qwen dense series, the Qwen MoE series, Qwen3-VL, and DeepSeek-V3 / V3.2-class MoE models (including GLM-4 / GLM-5 / GLM-5.1 and MiniMax-M2). It requires the `xlite` package to be installed and is configured through the `xlite_graph_config` additional-config key (see the `xlite_graph_config` table under [Configuration options](../configuration/additional_config.md#configuration-options)).

Install Xlite first:

```bash
pip install xlite
```

### Decode-only vs. full mode

XliteGraph has two modes, selected by `xlite_graph_config.full_mode`:

| Mode | `full_mode` | Prefill | Decode |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Decode-only** (default) | `False` | Falls back to the runnable / ACLGraph | Handled by the xlite runtime |
| **Full** | `True` | Handled by the xlite runtime | Handled by the xlite runtime |

In **decode-only mode**, xlite only owns the decode batches; prefill (and any mixed batch that exceeds the graph capacity) falls back to the native runnable, captured/replayed by ACLGraph. This is the default and is the recommended option — `Xlite` is still evolving, and decode-only mode is more performant and robust for most workloads.

In **full mode**, the xlite runtime drives both prefill and decode. Because xlite itself manages the full forward, ACLGraph capture should be disabled, especially under memory constraints, for higher concurrency and better performance.

### Supported models

The xlite adapter registers architectures by their `config.json` `architectures` field. The currently supported set:

| Architecture | Attention | Adapter |
|---|---|---|
| `LlamaForCausalLM`, `Qwen2ForCausalLM`, `Qwen3ForCausalLM` | MHA | `StandardXliteModel` |
| `Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration` | MHA (multimodal) | `StandardXliteModel` |
| `Qwen3MoeForCausalLM`, `Qwen3VLMoeForConditionalGeneration` | MHA + MoE | `QwenMoeXliteModel` |
| `Glm4MoeForCausalLM` | MHA + MoE | `Glm4MoeXliteModel` |
| `DeepseekV3ForCausalLM` | MLA + MoE | `DeepseekV3XliteModel` |
| `DeepseekV32ForCausalLM`, `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` | DSA + MoE | `DeepseekV32XliteModel` |
| `MiniMaxM2ForCausalLM` | MHA + MoE | `MiniMaxM2XliteModel` |

### Example

Serving `Qwen3-30B-A3B` (`Qwen3MoeForCausalLM`, MHA + MoE) on 4 NPU cards with tensor parallelism of 4, and expert parallelism enabled. Full mode is shown; drop `"full_mode": true` for decode-only.

Offline example:

```python
import os

from vllm import LLM

os.environ["HCCL_BUFFSIZE"] = "1024"
os.environ["TASK_QUEUE_ENABLE"] = "1"
os.environ["OMP_PROC_BIND"] = "false"
os.environ["HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE"] = "AIV"
os.environ["PYTORCH_NPU_ALLOC_CONF"] = "expandable_segments:True"

llm = LLM(
    model="path/to/Qwen3-30B-A3B",
    tensor_parallel_size=4,
    enable_expert_parallel=True,
    enforce_eager=True,  # recommended in xlite full mode without speculative decoding
    additional_config={"xlite_graph_config": {"enabled": True, "full_mode": True}},
)
outputs = llm.generate("Hello, how are you?")
```

Online example:

```bash
export HCCL_BUFFSIZE=1024
export TASK_QUEUE_ENABLE=1
export OMP_PROC_BIND=false
export HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE=AIV
export PYTORCH_NPU_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True

vllm serve path/to/Qwen3-30B-A3B \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
  --enable-expert-parallel \
  --enforce-eager \
  --additional-config '{"xlite_graph_config": {"enabled": true, "full_mode": true}}'
```

For more details about Xlite, see the [Xlite README](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/GVirt/blob/master/xlite/README.md).

## Common Limitations and Caveats

- XliteGraph should be treated as an alternative graph path, not as a drop-in replacement for ACLGraph in all scenarios.
- Model and backend coverage is still evolving, so a configuration that works for one model family may not yet be recommended for another.
- Encoder-decoder models currently do not keep `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`; on Ascend they fall back to `PIECEWISE` or `NONE` depending on compilation support.

## Fallback to Eager Mode

If you encounter issues with graph mode, you can temporarily fall back to eager mode by setting `enforce_eager=True`.

If ACL graph capture fails with the confirmed stream-resource signature in the error text, such as `207008` together with `Stream resources are insufficient` or `Insufficient_Stream_Resources`, vLLM Ascend will re-raise that capture failure with targeted mitigation guidance. In practice, the main levers are: upgrading to a newer HDK/CANN stack, reducing `cudagraph_capture_sizes`, lowering `max_cudagraph_capture_size`, or preferring `FULL` / `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` when the workload is mostly uniform decode.

**Offline example:**

```python
from vllm import LLM

llm = LLM(model="path/to/your/model", enforce_eager=True)
outputs = llm.generate("Hello, how are you?")
```

**Online example:**

```bash
vllm serve path/to/your/model --enforce-eager
```
