# Additional Configuration

Additional configuration is a mechanism provided by vLLM to allow plugins to control internal behavior by themselves. VLLM Ascend uses this mechanism to make the project more flexible.

## Migration Guide

Starting from [PR #9064](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/9064), vLLM Ascend is migrating **10 environment variables** to `--additional-config`.

### Important Notice

- **Current Support**: Both environment variables and `--additional-config` are supported during the transition period
- **Recommendation**: Use `--additional-config` for new deployments and migrate existing configurations
- **Future Plan**: Environment variables will be **removed** in a future release; only `--additional-config` will be supported

### Quick Reference

| Environment Variable | Config Key | Type Conversion |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| `VLLM_ASCEND_BALANCE_SCHEDULING` | `scheduler_config.enable_balance_scheduling` | `"1"` → `true`, `"0"` → `false` |
| `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_FLASHCOMM1` | `enable_flashcomm1` | `"1"` → `true`, `"0"` → `false` |
| `MSMONITOR_USE_DAEMON` | `msmonitor_use_daemon` | `"1"` → `true`, `"0"` → `false` |
| `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_MLAPO` | `enable_mlapo` | `"1"` → `true`, `"0"` → `false` |
| `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_NZ` | `weight_nz_mode` | Integer (unchanged, field name changed) |
| `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_CONTEXT_PARALLEL` | `enable_context_parallel` | `"1"` → `true`, `"0"` → `false` |
| `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_FUSED_MC2` | `enable_fused_mc2` | Integer (unchanged) |
| `VLLM_ASCEND_FUSION_OP_TRANSPOSE_KV_CACHE_BY_BLOCK` | `enable_transpose_kv_cache_by_block` | `"1"` → `true`, `"0"` → `false` |

### Example Migration

**Before (environment variable):**

```bash
export VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_FLASHCOMM1=1
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B
```

**After (additional-config):**

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B --additional-config='{"enable_flashcomm1": true}'
```

## How to use

With either online mode or offline mode, users can use additional configuration. Take Qwen3 as an example:

**Online mode**:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B --additional-config='{"config_key":"config_value"}'
```

**Offline mode**:

```python
from vllm import LLM

LLM(model="Qwen/Qwen3-8B", additional_config={"config_key":"config_value"})
```

### Configuration options

The following table lists additional configuration options available in vLLM Ascend:

| Name                                | Type | Default | Description                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------|------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `finegrained_tp_config`             | dict | `{}`    | Configuration options for module tensor parallelism                                                       |
| `ascend_compilation_config`         | dict | `{}`    | Configuration options for ascend compilation                                                              |
| `eplb_config`                       | dict | `{}`    | Configuration options for eplb |
| `scheduler_config`                  | dict | `{}`    | Configuration options for Ascend scheduler extensions, including balance scheduling, recompute scheduling, ShortRequestFirst, and dynamic chunked pipeline parallel. |
| `refresh`                           | bool | `false` | Whether to refresh global Ascend configuration content. This is usually used by rlhf or ut/e2e test case. |
| `dump_config`                       | dict | `None`  | Inline msprobe dump configuration. vLLM-Ascend will materialize it to a temporary JSON file and pass that file to the debugger. |
| `dump_config_path`                  | str  | `None`  | Configuration file path for msprobe dump (compatible legacy option).                                      |
| `enable_shared_expert_dp`           | bool | `False` | When the expert is shared in DP, it delivers better performance but consumes more memory. Currently only DeepSeek series models are supported. |
| `multistream_overlap_shared_expert` | bool | `False` | Whether to enable multi-stream shared expert. This option only takes effect on MoE models with shared experts. |
| `enable_cpu_binding`                | bool | `True`  | Enables Ascend-native CPU binding on ARM servers. Set to `False` to disable. See [CPU Binding](../feature_guide/cpu_binding.md). |
| `enable_sleep_mode_extra_cleanup`   | bool | `False` | Enables extra sleep-mode cleanup for RL workloads, including HCCL process-group release and ACL graph workspace cleanup. Disabled by default because wakeup may need to restore HCCL and recapture ACL graphs. |
| `pa_shape_list`                     | list | `[]`    | The custom shape list of page attention ops.                                                              |
| `enable_kv_nz`                      | bool | `False` | Whether to enable KV cache NZ layout. This option only takes effects on models using MLA (e.g., DeepSeek).                                      |
| `enable_sparse_c8`                  | bool | `False` | Whether to enable KV cache C8 in DSA models (e.g., DeepSeek V3.2 and GLM5). Not supported on Ascend 950 devices now |
| `c8_enable_reshape_optim`           | bool | `False` | Whether to enable StoreKVBlock operator achieves acceleration under the C8 feature (this means that enable_sparse_c8 needs to be enabled). In the PD separation scenario, only the P node is enabled. |
| `enable_mc2_hierarchy_comm`         | bool | `False` | Enable dispatch/combine op inter-node communication by ROCE. |
| `enable_prefill_mc2`                | bool | `False` | Whether to reserve mc2_token_capacity for prefill batches. When enabled, `max_num_batched_tokens` is used to calculate the mc2_token_capacity instead of the decode-only capacity. In this scenario, the recommended maximum value of `max_num_batched_tokens` is `tp_size * 512`. This is a temporary switch; once MC2 operators are complete for all scenarios, this switch will be removed and MC2 will be enabled by default. |
| `mega_moe_max_tokens`               | int  | `65536` | Per-rank token capacity after dispatch in the mega moe (dispatch_ffn_combine) fused operator. When load imbalance causes a rank to receive more tokens than this limit, the excess tokens are dropped and skipped from computation, degrading accuracy. Do not set this too large: workspace memory scales linearly with this value. |
| `enable_flashcomm1`                 | bool | `False` | Whether to enable FlashComm1 optimization. Can also be configured via the `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_FLASHCOMM1` environment variable during the migration period. |
| `msmonitor_use_daemon`              | bool | `False` | Whether to use daemon mode for msmonitor. Can also be configured via the `MSMONITOR_USE_DAEMON` environment variable during the migration period. |
| `enable_mlapo`                      | bool | `True`  | Whether to enable MLAPO (Model Layer-wise Adaptive Parallel Optimization). Can also be configured via the `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_MLAPO` environment variable during the migration period. |
| `weight_nz_mode`                    | int  | `1`     | Weight NZ mode. Can also be configured via the `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_NZ` environment variable during the migration period. |
| `enable_context_parallel`           | bool | `False` | Whether to enable context parallelism. Can also be configured via the `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_CONTEXT_PARALLEL` environment variable during the migration period. |
| `enable_fused_mc2`                  | int  | `0`     | Fused MC2 configuration. Can also be configured via the `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_FUSED_MC2` environment variable during the migration period. |
| `enable_transpose_kv_cache_by_block`| bool | `True`  | Whether to enable transpose KV cache by block. Can also be configured via the `VLLM_ASCEND_FUSION_OP_TRANSPOSE_KV_CACHE_BY_BLOCK` environment variable during the migration period. |
| `enable_dsa_cp`                     | bool | `False` | Whether to enable dsa_cp for DeepSeek V3.2, DeepSeek V4, and other models with the same architecture. This feature depends on FLASHCOMM1. Please ensure that FLASHCOMM1 is enabled before enabling this feature.|
| `rejection_sampler_config`          | dict | `{}`    | Configuration options for rejection sampler (block verify and entropy verify). |
| `multistream_dsv4_dsa_overlap`      | bool | `True`  | Whether to enable dsa multi-stream overlap for DeepSeek V4.  |
| `enable_reduce_sample`              | bool | `False` | Whether to enable reduce sample optimization to reduce communication and computation overheads in the tensor parallelism scenario. When enabled, logits are kept partitioned across TP ranks and only the small set of top-k candidate values/indices is communicated, instead of performing a full-vocabulary all-to-all/all-gather. |

The details of each configuration option are as follows:

**xlite_graph_config**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `enabled` | bool | `False` | Whether to enable Xlite graph mode. Currently only Llama, Qwen dense series models, and Qwen3-VL are supported. |
| `full_mode` | bool | `False` | Whether to enable Xlite for both the prefill and decode stages. By default, Xlite is only enabled for the decode stage. |

**finegrained_tp_config**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `lmhead_tensor_parallel_size`    | int  | `0` | The custom tensor parallel size of lm_head.    |
| `oproj_tensor_parallel_size`     | int  | `0` | The custom tensor parallel size of o_proj.     |
| `embedding_tensor_parallel_size` | int  | `0` | The custom tensor parallel size of embedding. |
| `mlp_tensor_parallel_size`       | int  | `0` | The custom tensor parallel size of mlp.       |

**ascend_compilation_config**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `enable_npugraph_ex`               | bool | `True` | Whether to enable npugraph_ex backend.                                                 |
| `enable_static_kernel` | bool | `False` | Whether to enable static kernel. Suitable for scenarios where shape changes are minimal and some time is available for static kernel compilation. |
| `fuse_norm_quant`  | bool | `True` | Whether to enable fuse_norm_quant pass. |
| `fuse_qknorm_rope` | bool | `True` | Whether to enable fuse_qknorm_rope pass. If Triton is not in the environment, set it to False. |
| `fuse_muls_add` | bool | `True` | Whether to enable fuse_muls_add pass.|

**eplb_config**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `dynamic_eplb`                   | bool| `False`| Whether to enable dynamic EPLB. |
| `expert_map_path`                | str | `None` | When using expert load balancing for an MoE model, an expert map path needs to be passed in.|

| `expert_map_record_path`         | str | `None` | Save the expert load calculation results to a new expert table in the specified directory.|
| `num_redundant_experts`          | int | `0`    | Specify redundant experts during initialization. |
| `eplb_policy_type`               | int | `1`    | EPLB balancing policy: `0`=Random, `1`=DefaultEplb (open-source algorithm), `2`=SwiftBalanceEplb (optimized for low-bandwidth), `3`=FlashLB (statistical method with sliding windows). |
| `eplb_heat_collection_stage`      | str | `"all"`| Stage to collect EPLB heat: `"prefill"` collects only during prefill, `"decode"` collects only during decode, `"all"` collects during both stages. In PD colocation scenarios, prefill and decode requests may produce different expert workloads. Selectively collecting heat on one stage can reduce expert imbalance more effectively. |

**scheduler_config**

The legacy top-level `enable_balance_scheduling`, `recompute_scheduler_enable`, `short_request_first_config`, and `profiling_chunk_config` keys remain supported during the migration period, but are deprecated. If both formats provide the same field, the value in `scheduler_config` takes precedence.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `enable_balance_scheduling` | bool | `False` | Whether to enable balance scheduling. Can also be configured via the `VLLM_ASCEND_BALANCE_SCHEDULING` environment variable during the migration period. |
| `recompute_scheduler_enable` | bool | `False` | Whether to enable the recompute scheduler. **Only valid on PD-disaggregated D nodes** (`kv_role` is `kv_consumer`). **Do not enable on P nodes or in PD-mixed mode** (no `kv_transfer_config`, `kv_role` is `kv_producer`, or `kv_role` is `kv_both`); startup will fail with a clear error. |
| `profiling_chunk_config` | dict | `{}` | Configuration options for dynamic chunked pipeline parallel. See [Dynamic Chunked Pipeline Parallel](../feature_guide/dynamic_chunk_pipeline_parallel.md) for details. |
| `short_request_first_config` | dict | `{}` | Configuration options for ShortRequestFirst prefill scheduling on FCFS synchronous or asynchronous, PD-prefill (P), or PD-mixed nodes. |
| `batch_job_sched_config` | dict | `{}` | Configuration options for the batch-job-aware scheduler. See [Batch-Job-Aware Scheduler](../feature_guide/batch_job_aware_scheduler.md) for details. |

**scheduler_config.profiling_chunk_config**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `enabled`       | bool  | `False` | Whether to enable dynamic chunked pipeline parallel. Requires `pipeline-parallel-size > 1`. |
| `smooth_factor` | float | `1.0`   | Smoothing factor (0 < x ≤ 1.0). Higher values trust the dynamic prediction more; `0.0` disables dynamic adjustment. |
| `min_chunk`     | int   | `4096`  | Minimum chunk size for dynamic calculation. Should be smaller than `max-num-batched-tokens`. |
| `need_timing` | bool | True | Enable/disable Online Calibration |
| `max_fit_chunk` | int | 30 | Number of chunk-time data for Online Calibration |

**rejection_sampler_config**

> **Note**: Both block verify and entropy verify improve speculative decoding performance (higher acceptance rate, lower latency) at the cost of reduced sampling precision. A larger `posterior_alpha` makes the adjustment more aggressive — it further lowers the acceptance threshold for high-entropy tokens, improving throughput but degrading output quality. Users should tune these parameters based on their specific model weights and application scenario to find the right trade-off between performance and precision.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `enable_block_verify`   | bool  | `False` | Whether to enable block verify mode. Block verify evaluates all draft tokens as a block using cumulative probability products, which can improve acceptance rate. |
| `enable_entropy_verify` | bool  | `False` | Whether to enable entropy verify mode. Entropy verify adjusts the acceptance threshold based on the entropy of the target distribution — higher entropy (uncertain) tokens get a lower threshold (easier to accept), while lower entropy (confident) tokens get a stricter threshold. |
| `posterior_threshold`   | float | `0.95`  | Upper bound for the entropy-adjusted acceptance threshold. Must be in (0, 1]. The effective threshold is `min(exp(-entropy * posterior_alpha), posterior_threshold)`. |
| `posterior_alpha`       | float | `0.4`   | Scaling factor for entropy in the threshold computation. Must be >= 0. Higher values make the threshold more sensitive to entropy — high-entropy tokens become much easier to accept, improving performance but reducing precision. |

**scheduler_config.short_request_first_config**

ShortRequestFirst is a waiting-queue policy for FCFS synchronous or asynchronous scheduling on prefill and PD-mixed paths. It does not support batch-job-aware, profiling-chunk, or PD-disaggregated D-node scheduling. See [ShortRequestFirst Prefill Scheduling](../feature_guide/short_request_first.md) for usage, behavior, and tuning guidance.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `enabled`                | bool  | `False` | Whether to enable ShortRequestFirst scheduling. |
| `threshold`              | int   | `256`   | Prompt-length threshold (tokens). Requests with `num_prompt_tokens <= threshold` are treated as short prefills and prioritized over long prefills. |
| `long_max_wait_ms`       | float | `0.0`   | Maximum time a long prefill may wait behind short prefills before it can be promoted ahead of them. `0` disables long-request promotion and keeps strict short-request priority. |

**scheduler_config.batch_job_sched_config**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Enable the batch-job-aware scheduler. |
| `max_jobs` | int | `20` | Maximum number of tracked jobs. `0` means unlimited. |
| `reserve_margin_blocks` | int | `2` | Extra block margin added to the KV cache reserve as safety buffer. |
| `reserve_max_blocks` | int | `8` | Maximum number of blocks that can be reserved. |
| `low_available_tokens_threshold` | int | `4096` | Threshold for prioritising long vs short decode jobs. When available tokens > threshold, long decode jobs are prioritised; when ≤ threshold, short decode jobs are prioritised. |
| `short_decode_token_threshold` | int | `32` | Threshold for classifying a job as "short decode". |
