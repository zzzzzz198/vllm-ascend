Refer to [feature guide](../../user_guide/feature_guide/index.md) to get the feature's configuration.

## 3 Prerequisites

### 3.1 Model Weight

- `Kimi-K2-Thinking` (bfloat16): requires 1 Atlas 800 A3 (64G × 16) node. [Download model weight](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking).

It is recommended to download the model weight to the shared directory, such as `/mnt/sfs_turbo/.cache/`.

After downloading the model weights, please edit the value of `"quantization_config.config_groups.group_0.targets"` from `["Linear"]` to `["MoE"]` in `config.json` of the original model to use the quantized model.

```json
{
  "quantization_config": {
    "config_groups": {
      "group_0": {
        "targets": [
          "MoE"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Your model files should look like:

```bash
.
|-- chat_template.jinja
|-- config.json
|-- configuration_deepseek.py
|-- configuration.json
|-- generation_config.json
|-- model-00001-of-000062.safetensors
|-- ...
|-- model-00062-of-000062.safetensors
|-- model.safetensors.index.json
|-- modeling_deepseek.py
|-- tiktoken.model
|-- tokenization_kimi.py
|-- tokenizer_config.json
```

## 4 Installation

```

**Parameter Descriptions:**

- `IMAGE`: specifies the `vllm-ascend` image. The `-a3` suffix selects the Atlas A3 image.
- `NAME`: specifies the container name.
- `--net=host`: uses host networking, so the vLLM service port is exposed on the host directly.
- `--shm-size=1g`: configures container shared memory.
- `--device /dev/davinci[0-15]`: exposes 16 Ascend NPU devices to the container.
- `--device /dev/davinci_manager`, `--device /dev/devmm_svm`, and `--device /dev/hisi_hdc`: expose required Ascend runtime device files.
- `-v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi`: mounts DCMI tools for device management.
- `-v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi`: mounts the NPU monitoring command.
- `-v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/*`: mounts Ascend driver libraries and version files.
- `-v /etc/ascend_install.info:/etc/ascend_install.info`: mounts Ascend installation metadata.
- `-v /mnt/sfs_turbo/.cache:/home/cache`: mounts the shared model cache directory. Update it if you store model weights elsewhere.

After the container starts, run the following command on the host to verify the container status:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=vllm-ascend --format "table {% raw %}{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}{% endraw %}"
```

Expected Status:

- The container name is `vllm-ascend`.
- The status is `Up ...`.
- The container does not exit immediately.

Run the following command in the container to verify that Ascend devices are visible:

```bash
npu-smi info
```

Expected Status:

- The command exits successfully.
- The output lists the expected NPU devices.
- Device health status is normal.

### 4.2 Source Code Installation

If you do not want to use the Docker image, you can also build from source:

```bash
# Install vLLM.
git clone --depth 1 --branch {{ vllm_version }} https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm
cd vllm
VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE=empty pip install -e .
cd ..

# Install vLLM Ascend.
git clone --depth 1 --branch {{ vllm_ascend_version }} https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend.git
cd vllm-ascend
pip install -e .
```

To verify the source installation, run:

```bash
python -c "import vllm; import vllm_ascend; print('vllm and vllm_ascend import ok')"
```

Expected Status:

- The command exits successfully.
- `vllm and vllm_ascend import ok` is printed.

## 5 Online Service Deployment {: #5-online-service-deployment }

### 5.1 Single-Node Online Deployment

Single-node deployment completes both Prefill and Decode within the same node, suitable for online inference scenarios with moderate concurrency requirements.

For an Atlas 800 A3 (64G × 16) node, `tensor-parallel-size` should be at least 16.

Run the following script to start the vLLM server:

```{model-code}
:block_name: kimi_k2_thinking_single_node
:converter_tag: single_node
:test_case_path: tests/e2e/nightly/single_node/models/configs/Kimi-K2-Thinking.yaml
```

**Parameter and Environment Variable Descriptions:**

The following table covers the generated `model`, all `envs`, and all `server_cmd` entries. Parameters are categorized by review priority: version-sensitive parameters, performance parameters, and Kimi-K2-Thinking-specific parameters.

| Parameter | Validated Value | Category | Description and Tuning Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking` | model path | Model-specific | Specifies the model weight path passed to `vllm serve`. Because `--served-model-name` is not set in the script, API requests must use `moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking` as the model name unless you add an explicit served-model-name override; see the FAQ in Chapter 10. |
| `HCCL_BUFFSIZE` | `1024` | Performance | Configures the HCCL communication buffer used by distributed NPU communication. This document validates `1024`; other values need separate throughput, TTFT, TPOT, and HCCL stability validation. |
| `TASK_QUEUE_ENABLE` | `1` | Version-sensitive / Performance | Enables task queue scheduling on Ascend. This document validates `1`; other values or version changes need startup and first-request validation. |
| `OMP_PROC_BIND` | `false` | Performance | Avoids overly strict OpenMP CPU binding. This document validates `false`; other values need separate CPU affinity, NPU health, and HCCL stability validation. |
| `HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE` | `AIV` | Performance | Enables the AIV communication path. This document validates `AIV`; other values need separate throughput and latency validation. |
| `PYTORCH_NPU_ALLOC_CONF` | `expandable_segments:True` | Memory / Performance | Reduces NPU memory fragmentation. This document validates `expandable_segments:True`; other allocator settings need separate startup, memory, and runtime stability validation. |
| `SERVER_PORT` and `--port` | `8000` | Service | Sets the OpenAI-compatible service port. The documentation generator maps `DEFAULT_PORT` in the YAML to `8000`; update the curl examples if you change this value. |
| `--tensor-parallel-size` | `16` | Model-specific / Performance | Uses all 16 NPUs on one Atlas 800 A3 node. This document validates `tp16`; other topologies need separate memory, accuracy, and communication validation. |
| `--max-model-len` | `8192` | Performance | Sets the maximum input plus output tokens for one request and determines KV cache reservation. This document validates `8192`; larger values need separate NPU memory, accuracy, and performance validation. Keep it close to the real maximum input and output length for your workload. |
| `--max-num-batched-tokens` | `8192` | Performance | Limits tokens processed in one scheduler step. This document validates `8192`; other values need separate memory, TTFT, TPOT, and throughput validation. |
| `--max-num-seqs` | `12` | Performance | Limits active sequences scheduled at the same time. This document validates `12`; higher values need separate tail-latency and throughput validation. The reference sweep in Chapter 8 shows concurrency 16 causes severe TTFT growth; validate tail latency before raising it in production. |
| `--gpu-memory-utilization` | `0.9` | Memory / Performance | Controls the fraction of NPU HBM used by vLLM for KV cache planning. This document validates `0.9`; other values need separate startup, OOM, and runtime stability validation. |
| `--trust-remote-code` | enabled | Model-specific | Required because the model package contains model-specific configuration, modeling, tokenizer, and chat-template files. Disable it only after replacing the remote-code dependency with a validated native implementation. |
| `--enable-expert-parallel` | enabled | Model-specific / Performance | Enables expert parallelism for Kimi-K2-Thinking MoE layers so experts can be distributed across NPUs. This document validates it as enabled; disabling it is not validated in this tutorial. |
| `--no-enable-prefix-caching` | enabled | Performance | Disables prefix caching for the validated baseline and random-prompt benchmarks. Prefix caching is not validated in this tutorial. |

**Common Issues Tip:** For common environment, installation, and general parameter issues during deployment, please refer to the [Public FAQ](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/ascend/en/latest/faqs.html). If the service runs under high concurrency, verify NPU health and HCCL status before increasing the request rate.

**Service Verification:**

After the service starts, you should see logs similar to:

```bash
INFO:     Started server process [...]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

Expected Status:

- The server process starts successfully.
- No error logs related to HCCL or NPU initialization.
- The container does not exit immediately.

## 6 Functional Verification

After the service is started, the model can be invoked by sending a prompt:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"}
  ],
  "temperature": 1.0
}'
```

Expected Result:

- The HTTP status code is `200`.
- `choices[0].message.content` contains the generated assistant response.

## 7 Accuracy Evaluation

### Using AISBench

For details, please refer to [Using AISBench](../../developer_guide/evaluation/using_ais_bench.md).

### Using lm-eval

You can use [lm-eval](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) to evaluate the model accuracy through the OpenAI-compatible API.

For `lm_eval` installation, please refer to [Using lm_eval](../../developer_guide/evaluation/using_lm_eval.md).

Run `lm_eval` to execute the accuracy evaluation:

```shell
lm_eval \
  --model local-completions \
  --model_args model=moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking,base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/completions,tokenized_requests=False,trust_remote_code=True \
  --tasks gsm8k \
  --output_path ./
```

Reference configuration: `gsm8k` (5-shot), `--apply_chat_template`, `--fewshot_as_multiturn`, greedy decoding (`temperature=0.0`, `top_p=1.0`), max 2048 output tokens, batch size 1.

Below are reference `gsm8k` results for `Kimi-K2-Thinking` powered by `vllm-ascend:v0.20.2rc1`, evaluated on one Atlas 800 A3 node (64G × 16).

| task | version | filter | n-shot | metric | value | stderr |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `gsm8k` | 3 | `flexible-extract` | 5 | `exact_match` | 0.8992 | 0.0083 |
| `gsm8k` | 3 | `strict-match` | 5 | `exact_match` | 0.8453 | 0.0100 |

## 8 Performance Evaluation

Refer to [vllm benchmark](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/benchmarking/) for more details.

**Test Command Example:**

```bash
vllm bench serve \
  --backend openai-chat \
  --model moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking \
  --endpoint /v1/chat/completions \
  --dataset-name random \
  --random-input-len 1024 \
  --random-output-len 1024 \
  --num-prompts 10 \
  --request-rate 1
```

After the benchmark completes, you can get the performance result, including request throughput, output token throughput, TTFT, TPOT, and ITL.

The following reference results are obtained with `vllm-ascend:v0.20.2rc1` on one Atlas 800 A3 node (64G × 16), using OpenAI chat serving, random input/output lengths, 10 prompts, and `--request-rate 1`:

| random input len | random output len | success | duration (s) | request throughput (req/s) | output throughput (tok/s) | total throughput (tok/s) | mean TTFT (ms) | mean TPOT (ms) | mean ITL (ms) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512 | 512 | 10 / 10 | 111.00 | 0.09 | 46.12 | 94.38 | 507.60 | 200.47 | 200.08 |
| 1024 | 1024 | 10 / 10 | 221.52 | 0.05 | 46.23 | 93.48 | 566.39 | 208.20 | 208.00 |
| 2048 | 2048 | 10 / 10 | 479.72 | 0.02 | 42.69 | 85.78 | 722.32 | 230.26 | 230.15 |

For a concurrency sweep, keep the input and output length fixed and vary `--max-concurrency`:

```bash
MODEL_NAME=moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking
INPUT_LEN=1024
OUTPUT_LEN=1024

for CONCURRENCY in 1 2 4 8 16 32; do
  NUM_PROMPTS=$((CONCURRENCY * 10))
  vllm bench serve \
    --backend openai-chat \
    --model "$MODEL_NAME" \
    --endpoint /v1/chat/completions \
    --dataset-name random \
    --random-input-len "$INPUT_LEN" \
    --random-output-len "$OUTPUT_LEN" \
    --num-prompts "$NUM_PROMPTS" \
    --request-rate inf \
    --max-concurrency "$CONCURRENCY"
done
```

Reference results for 1024 input tokens and 1024 output tokens are:

| max concurrency | prompts | success | duration (s) | request throughput (req/s) | output throughput (tok/s) | total throughput (tok/s) | mean TTFT (ms) | P99 TTFT (ms) | mean TPOT (ms) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 10 | 10 / 10 | 595.07 | 0.02 | 17.21 | 34.80 | 473.71 | 712.49 | 57.71 |
| 2 | 20 | 20 / 20 | 623.88 | 0.03 | 32.83 | 66.35 | 708.16 | 996.59 | 60.29 |
| 4 | 40 | 40 / 40 | 725.38 | 0.06 | 56.47 | 114.13 | 956.11 | 1137.55 | 69.97 |
| 8 | 80 | 80 / 80 | 907.44 | 0.09 | 90.28 | 182.43 | 1361.85 | 1900.15 | 87.37 |
| 16 | 160 | 160 / 160 | 3093.07 | 0.05 | 52.97 | 107.04 | 76766.84 | 251245.22 | 222.07 |

> **Note:** At concurrency levels of 16, the Mean TTFT increases significantly (76.7s), indicating severe queueing delay. For production deployment, it is recommended to limit concurrency based on your latency requirements or increase `--max-num-seqs` and `--max-num-batched-tokens` if NPU memory allows.

## 9 Performance Tuning

### 9.1 Recommended Configurations

> **Note:** The following configurations are validated in specific test environments and are for reference only. The optimal configuration depends on factors such as maximum input/output length, prefix cache hit rate, precision requirements, and deployment machine ratios. It is recommended to refer to Section 9.2 for tuning based on actual conditions.

#### Table 1: Scenario Overview

| Scenario | Deployment Mode | Total NPUs | Weight Version | Key Considerations |
|----------|----------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Long Context | Single-node | 16 (A3) | bfloat16 | Keep `--max-model-len` close to the real maximum input and output length, and reduce `--max-num-seqs` first when memory pressure is high. The validated scope of this single-node baseline covers up to 2K input / 2K output in Chapter 8. |
| Low Latency | Single-node | 16 (A3) | bfloat16 | Reduce `--max-num-seqs` and `--max-num-batched-tokens` from the validated baseline (`12` and `8192`) to reduce queueing delay. In the Chapter 8 concurrency sweep, concurrency 1-4 kept mean TTFT below 1s; validate TTFT, TPOT, and tail latency against the target latency SLO. |
| High Throughput | Single-node | 16 (A3) | bfloat16 | Increase `--max-num-seqs` gradually and benchmark with a request rate close to the real workload. In the 1K/1K concurrency sweep in Chapter 8, concurrency 8 gave the best output throughput; validate tail latency before using higher concurrency in production. |

### 9.2 Tuning Guidelines

#### 9.2.1 General Tuning Reference

Please refer to the [Public Performance Tuning Documentation](../../developer_guide/performance_and_debug/optimization_and_tuning.md) for general tuning methods.

Please refer to the [Feature Guide](../../user_guide/support_matrix/feature_matrix.md) for detailed feature descriptions.

## 10 FAQ

> For common environment, installation, and general parameter issues, please refer to the [Public FAQ](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/ascend/en/latest/faqs.html); this chapter only covers model-specific issues.

- **Q: API returns `{"error":"Model not found"}` or `404` when requesting with `model: "Kimi-K2-Thinking"`?**

  A: The server registers the model under its full path `moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking` by default. When the request uses the short name `Kimi-K2-Thinking` without `--served-model-name` override, the server cannot resolve the model ID. Use `"model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking"` in requests, or start the server with `--served-model-name Kimi-K2-Thinking` to enable the short name.
