  <a href="Model-Deployment-Tutorial-Template.md"><b>English</b></a> | <a href="Model-Deployment-Tutorial-Template.zh.md"><b>中文</b></a>
</p>

This template is based on deployment tutorials for models such as DeepSeek-V3.2 and Qwen-VL-Dense, and is intended to serve as a reference for technical documentation writing. Users can systematically construct relevant technical documentation by following the guidelines provided in this template.

## 1 Introduction

**Content Writing Requirements:**

- Provide a one-sentence description of the model's basic architecture, core features, and primary application scenarios.
- Provide a one-sentence description of the document's purpose and the objectives to be achieved.
- Specify the version of vLLM-Ascend used in the document and the version support status of the model.

**Example 1: Model Introduction**

DeepSeek-V3.2 is a sparse attention model. Its core architecture is similar to that of DeepSeek-V3.1, but it employs a sparse attention mechanism, aiming to explore and validate optimization solutions for training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios.

**Example 2: Document Purpose**

This document will demonstrate the primary validation steps for the model, including supported features, feature configuration, environment preparation, single-node and multi-node deployment, as well as accuracy and performance evaluation.

**Example 3: Version Information**

This document is validated and written based on **vLLM-Ascend v0.13.0**. The current model (XXX) is fully supported in this version, and all **v0.13.0 and later versions** can run stably. To use the latest features (e.g., PD separation, MTP), it is recommended to use the latest release candidate or official version.

## 2 Supported Features

This section introduces the features supported by the model, including supported hardware, quantization methods, data parallelism, long-sequence features, etc.

**Content Writing Requirements:**

- Present the support status of models and features in a table format.
- Or provide cross-references with jump links (recommended).

## 9 Performance Tuning

### 9.1 Recommended Configurations

**Content Writing Requirements:**

Provide recommended configurations for three typical scenarios (long context, low latency, high throughput). Clearly state that the configurations are not globally optimal and guide users to perform tuning based on their actual circumstances.

**Example:**

> **Note**: The following configurations are validated in specific test environments and are for reference only. The optimal configuration depends on factors such as maximum input/output length, prefix cache hit rate, precision requirements, and deployment machine ratios. It is recommended to refer to Section 9.2 for tuning based on actual conditions.

#### Table 1: Scenario Overview

| Scenario | Deployment Mode | *Total NPUs | Weight Version | Key Considerations |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| High Throughput<br>(32K context → 1K output) | 1P1D deployment | 16 (A3) | glm5.1w4a8 | For short-sequence high throughput, try adjusting xxx parameters |
| Long Context | | | | |
| Low Latency | | | | |

> `*Total NPUs` indicates the total number of NPUs used across all nodes.

> For complete startup commands and parameter descriptions, please refer to the deployment examples in Chapter 5.

### 9.2 Tuning Guidelines

#### 9.2.1 General Tuning Reference

**Content Writing Requirements:**

If no special tuning is involved, directly provide a feature combination table and a link to the public performance tuning documentation.

**Example:**

Please refer to the [Public Performance Tuning Documentation](../../developer_guide/performance_and_debug/optimization_and_tuning.md) for tuning methods.
Please refer to the [Feature Guide](../../user_guide/support_matrix/feature_matrix.md) for detailed feature descriptions.

#### 9.2.2 Model-Specific Optimizations (Optional)

**Documentation Requirements:**

If the model has specific optimizations, summarize the key optimization techniques and tuning experience for this model.

**Example:**

#### Optimizations Enabled by Default

The following optimizations are enabled by default and require no additional configuration:

| Optimization Technique | Technical Principle | Performance Benefit |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Rope Optimization | The cos_sin_cache and indexing operations of positional encoding are executed only in the first layer, and subsequent layers reuse them directly | Reduces redundant computation during the decoding phase, accelerating inference |
| AddRMSNormQuant Fusion | Merges address-wise multi-scale normalization and quantization operations into a single operator | Optimizes memory access patterns, improving computational efficiency |
| Zero-like Elimination | Removes unnecessary zero-tensor operations in Attention forward pass | Reduces memory footprint, improves matrix operation efficiency |
| FullGraph Optimization | Captures and replays the entire decoding graph at once using `compilation_config={"cudagraph_mode":"FULL_DECODE_ONLY"}` | Significantly reduces scheduling latency, stabilizes multi-device performance |

#### Optimizations That Require Explicit Enabling

| Optimization Technique | Applicable Scenarios | Enablement Method | Technical Principle | Precautions |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| FlashComm_v1 | High-concurrency, Tensor Parallelism (TP) scenarios | `export VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_FLASHCOMM1=1` | Decomposes traditional Allreduce into Reduce-Scatter and All-Gather, reducing RMSNorm computation dimensions | Threshold protection: Only takes effect when the actual number of tokens exceeds the threshold to avoid performance degradation in low-concurrency scenarios |
| Matmul-ReduceScatter Fusion | Large-scale distributed environments | Automatically enabled after enabling FlashComm_v1 | Fuses matrix multiplication and Reduce-Scatter operations to achieve pipelined parallel processing | Same as FlashComm_v1, has threshold protection |
