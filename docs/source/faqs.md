- [Experimental] Atlas 300I Inference series (Atlas 300I Duo).
- [Experimental] Currently for 310I Duo the stable version is vllm-ascend v0.10.0rc1.

Below series are NOT supported yet:

- Atlas 200I A2 (Ascend-cann-kernels-310b) unplanned yet
- Ascend 910, Ascend 910 Pro B (Ascend-cann-kernels-910) unplanned yet

From a technical view, vllm-ascend supports devices if TorchNPU is supported. Otherwise, we have to implement it by using custom ops. We also welcome you to join us to improve together.

### 2. How to get our docker containers?

You can get our containers at `Quay.io`, e.g., [<u>vllm-ascend</u>](https://quay.io/repository/ascend/vllm-ascend?tab=tags) and [<u>cann</u>](https://quay.io/repository/ascend/cann?tab=tags).

If you are in China, you can use `daocloud` or some other mirror sites to accelerate your downloading:

```bash
# Replace with tag you want to pull
TAG=v0.9.1
docker pull m.daocloud.io/quay.io/ascend/vllm-ascend:$TAG
# or
docker pull quay.nju.edu.cn/ascend/vllm-ascend:$TAG
```

#### Load Docker Images for offline environment

If you want to use container image for offline environments (no internet connection), you need to download container image in an environment with internet access:

**Exporting Docker images:**

```bash
# Pull the image on a machine with internet access
TAG={{ vllm_ascend_version }}
docker pull quay.io/ascend/vllm-ascend:$TAG

# Export the image to a tar file and compress to tar.gz
docker save quay.io/ascend/vllm-ascend:$TAG | gzip > vllm-ascend-$TAG.tar.gz
```

**Importing Docker images in environment without internet access:**

```bash
# Transfer the tar/tar.gz file to the offline environment and load it
TAG={{ vllm_ascend_version }}
docker load -i vllm-ascend-$TAG.tar.gz

# Verify the image is loaded
docker images | grep vllm-ascend
```

### 5. What features does vllm-ascend V1 support?

Find more details [<u>here</u>](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/ascend/en/latest/user_guide/support_matrix/supported_features.html).

### 6. How to solve the problem of "Failed to infer device type" or "libatb.so: cannot open shared object file"?

Basically, the reason is that the NPU environment is not configured correctly. You can:

1. try `source /usr/local/Ascend/nnal/atb/set_env.sh` to enable NNAL package.
2. try `source /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/set_env.sh` to enable CANN package.
3. try `npu-smi info` to check whether the NPU is working.

If the above steps are not working, you can try the following code in Python to check whether there are any errors:

```python
import torch
import torch_npu
import vllm
```

If all above steps are not working, feel free to submit a GitHub issue.

### 7. How does vllm-ascend work with vLLM?

`vllm-ascend` is a hardware plugin for vLLM. Stable releases usually align with the same vLLM version, while RC releases may use the corresponding vLLM final release version. For example, `vllm-ascend` `v0.18.0rc1` matches vLLM `v0.18.0`. For the main branch, we ensure that `vllm-ascend` and `vllm` are compatible at every commit.

### 8. Does vllm-ascend support Prefill-Decode (PD) Disaggregation feature?

Yes, vllm-ascend supports Prefill-Decode Disaggregation feature with Mooncake backend. See the [official tutorial](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/ascend/en/latest/tutorials/features/pd_disaggregation_mooncake_multi_node.html) for example.

### 9. Does vllm-ascend support quantization method?

Currently, w8a8, w4a8, and w4a4 quantization methods are already supported by vllm-ascend.

### 10. How is vllm-ascend tested?

vllm-ascend is tested in three aspects: functions, performance, and accuracy.

- **Functional test**: We added CI, including part of vllm's native unit tests and vllm-ascend's own unit tests. In vllm-ascend's tests, we test basic functionalities, popular model availability, and [supported features](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/ascend/en/latest/user_guide/support_matrix/supported_features.html) through E2E test.

- **Performance test**: We provide [benchmark](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/tree/main/benchmarks) tools for E2E performance benchmark, which can be easily re-run locally. We will publish a perf website to show the performance test results for each pull request.

- **Accuracy test**: We are working on adding accuracy test to the CI as well.

- **Nightly test**: we'll run full test every night to make sure the code is working.

For each release, we'll publish the performance test and accuracy test report in the future.

### 11. How to fix the error "InvalidVersion" when using vllm-ascend?

The problem is usually caused by the installation of a development or editable version of the vLLM package. In this case, we provide the environment variable `VLLM_VERSION` to let users specify the version of vLLM package to use. Please set the environment variable `VLLM_VERSION` to the version of the vLLM package you have installed. The format of `VLLM_VERSION` should be `X.Y.Z`.

### 12. How to handle the out-of-memory issue?

OOM errors typically occur when the model exceeds the memory capacity of a single NPU. For general guidance, you can refer to [vLLM OOM troubleshooting documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/usage/troubleshooting/#out-of-memory).

In scenarios where NPUs have limited high bandwidth memory (on-chip memory) capacity, dynamic memory allocation/deallocation during inference can exacerbate memory fragmentation, leading to OOM. To address this:

- **Limit `--max-model-len`**: It can save the on-chip memory usage for KV cache initialization step.

- **Adjust `--gpu-memory-utilization`**: If unspecified, the default value is `0.9`. You can decrease this value to reserve more memory to reduce fragmentation risks. See details in: [vLLM - Inference and Serving - Engine Arguments](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/cli/serve/#-gpu-memory-utilization).

- **Configure `PYTORCH_NPU_ALLOC_CONF`**: Set this environment variable to optimize NPU memory management. For example, you can use `export PYTORCH_NPU_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` to enable virtual memory feature to mitigate memory fragmentation caused by frequent dynamic memory size adjustments during runtime. See details in [PYTORCH_NPU_ALLOC_CONF](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/Pytorch/700/comref/Envvariables/Envir_012.html).

### 13. Failed to enable NPU graph mode when running DeepSeek

Enabling NPU graph mode for DeepSeek may trigger an error. This is because when both MLA (Multi-Head Latent Attention) and NPU graph mode are active, the number of queries per KV head must be 32, 64, or 128. However, DeepSeek-V2-Lite has only 16 attention heads, which results in 16 queries per KV—a value outside the supported range. Support for NPU graph mode on DeepSeek-V2-Lite will be added in a future update.

And if you're using DeepSeek-V3 or DeepSeek-R1, please make sure after the tensor parallel split, `num_heads`/`num_kv_heads` is {32, 64, 128}.

```bash
[rank0]: RuntimeError: EZ9999: Inner Error!
[rank0]: EZ9999: [PID: 62938] 2025-05-27-06:52:12.455.807 numHeads / numKvHeads = 8, MLA only support {32, 64, 128}.[FUNC:CheckMlaAttrs][FILE:incre_flash_attention_tiling_check.cc][LINE:1218]
```

### 14. Failed to reinstall vllm-ascend from source after uninstalling vllm-ascend

You may encounter the problem of C/C++ compilation failure when reinstalling vllm-ascend from source using pip. If the installation fails, use `python setup.py install` (recommended) to install, or use `python setup.py clean` to clear the cache.

### 15. How to generate deterministic results when using vllm-ascend?

There are several factors that affect output determinism:

1. Sampler method: using **greedy sampling** by setting `temperature=0` in `SamplingParams`, e.g.:

   ```python
   from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

   prompts = [
      "Hello, my name is",
      "The president of the United States is",
      "The capital of France is",
      "The future of AI is",
   ]

   # Create a sampling params object.
   sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0)
   # Create an LLM.
   llm = LLM(model="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B")

   # Generate texts from the prompts.
   outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)
   for output in outputs:
      prompt = output.prompt
      generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
      print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")
   ```

2. Set the following environment parameters:

   ```bash
   export LCCL_DETERMINISTIC=1
   export HCCL_DETERMINISTIC=true
   export ATB_MATMUL_SHUFFLE_K_ENABLE=0
   export ATB_LLM_LCOC_ENABLE=0
   ```

### 16. How to fix the error "ImportError: Please install vllm[audio] for audio support" for the multi-modal models?

Some multi-modal models requires the `librosa` package to be installed, you need to install the `qwen-omni-utils` package to ensure all dependencies are met, for Qwen-omni, run `pip install qwen-omni-utils`.
This package will install `librosa` and its related dependencies, resolving the `ImportError: No module named 'librosa'` issue and ensuring that the audio processing functionality works correctly.

### 17. How to troubleshoot and resolve size capture failures resulting from stream resource exhaustion, and what are the underlying causes?

```text
capture_begin:../torch_npu/csrc/core/npu/NPUGraph.cpp:230 NPU function error: c10_npu::acl::AclmdlRICaptureBegin(capture_stream_, capture_mode), error code is 207008
[Error]: Stream resources are insufficient.
[PID: ...] Insufficient_Stream_Resources(EL0009): The stream resources are insufficient.
```

When vLLM Ascend recognizes this capture-time stream-resource signature in the error text, it re-raises the error with targeted guidance for ACL graph sizing and mitigation.

Recommended mitigation strategies:

1. Upgrade to a newer HDK/CANN stack if one is available for your environment. Recent releases improve ACL graph capacity, so older workarounds may no longer be necessary.
2. Manually reduce the configured graph sizes, for example: '{"cudagraph_capture_sizes":[size1, size2, size3, ...]}', or lower `max_cudagraph_capture_size`.
3. If your workload is mostly uniform decode, try ACLGraph's `FULL` or `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` mode instead of the `PIECEWISE`.
4. If you use `PIECEWISE` or `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` and still hit this failure after upgrading, set `cudagraph_capture_sizes` manually according to your real workload and reduce the configured coverage.
5. If you are debugging a startup failure, temporarily disable graph mode (`cudagraph_mode="NONE"` / `enforce_eager=True`) to confirm the issue is capture-related.

Root cause analysis:
ACL graph capture can still fail when the runtime resources required by the selected graph sizes exceed what the current software/hardware stack can provide. This is most visible in `PIECEWISE` scenarios because the number of captured graphs scales with model depth and capture-size coverage. vLLM Ascend no longer auto-shrinks the PIECEWISE capture-size set locally, so the practical mitigations are to upgrade the HDK/CANN stack or reduce the configured graph sizes explicitly. The runtime guidance is intentionally narrow: it is only added when capture fails with the confirmed stream-resource signature above.

### 18. How to install custom version of torch_npu?

TorchNPU will be overridden when installing vllm-ascend. If you need to install a specific version of TorchNPU, you can manually install the specified version of TorchNPU after vllm-ascend is installed.

### 19. On certain systems (e.g., Kylin OS), `docker pull` may fail with an `invalid tar header` error

On certain operating systems, such as Kylin OS, you may encounter an `invalid tar header` error during the `docker pull` process:

```text
failed to register layer: ApplyLayer exit status 1 stdout: stderr: archive/tar: invalid tar header
```

This is often due to system compatibility issues. You can resolve this by using an offline loading method with a second machine.

1. On a separate host machine (e.g., a standard Ubuntu server), pull the image for the target ARM64 architecture and package it into a `.tar` file.

   ```bash
   export IMAGE_TAG=v0.10.0rc1-310p
   export IMAGE_NAME="quay.io/ascend/vllm-ascend:${IMAGE_TAG}"
   # If in China region, uncomment to use a mirror:
   # export IMAGE_NAME="m.daocloud.io/quay.io/ascend/vllm-ascend:${IMAGE_TAG}"
   
   # Pull the image for the ARM64 platform and save it
   docker pull --platform linux/arm64 "${IMAGE_NAME}"
   docker save -o "vllm_ascend_${IMAGE_TAG}.tar" "${IMAGE_NAME}"
   ```

2. Transfer the image archive

Copy the `vllm_ascend_<tag>.tar` file (where `<tag>` is the image tag you used) to your target machine

### 20. Why am I getting an error when executing the script to start a Docker container? The error message is: "operation not permitted"

When using `--shm-size`, you may need to add the `--privileged=true` flag to your `docker run` command to grant the container necessary permissions. Please be aware that using `--privileged=true` grants the container extensive privileges on the host system, which can be a security risk. Only use this option if you understand the implications and trust the container's source.

### 21. How to set `SOC_VERSION` when building from source on a CPU-only machine?

When building from source (e.g. `pip install -e .`), the build may try to infer the target chip via `npu-smi`. If `npu-smi` is not available (common in CPU-only build environments), you must set `SOC_VERSION` manually before installation.

You can use the defaults from `Dockerfile*` as a reference. For example:

```bash
# Atlas A2
export SOC_VERSION="ascend910b1"

# Atlas A3
export SOC_VERSION="ascend910_9391"

# Atlas 300I
export SOC_VERSION="ascend310p1"

# Ascend 950 Products
export SOC_VERSION="<value starting with ascend950>"
```

### 22. Why does TPOT increase drastically as concurrency grows?

When testing a vLLM server, one may find that TPOT increases as concurrency increases (for example, TPOT increases by 0.5 ~ 1ms when concurrency increases by 4). This phenomenon is normal in most cases. However, sometimes TPOT may increase dramatically (10 to 100ms for example) as concurrency grows. This is possibly caused by [**PREEMPTION**](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/configuration/optimization/#preemption) in vLLM.
Generally, when your server hits KV cache limits, vLLM tries to free KV cache of requests to ensure sufficient space for other requests, which is called preemption in vLLM. When a request is preempted, the default behavior is to recompute the KV cache of this request again in the future, which is why the performance might drop significantly. There are several ways to verify this:

- vLLM usually logs stats on your server. You might see metrics like `GPU KV cache usage: 99.0%,`. When reaching 100%, it triggers preemption.
- When launching a vLLM server, you will see logs like `GPU KV cache size: 66340 tokens` and `Maximum concurrency for 16,384 tokens per request: 4.05`. These are estimated KV cache capacity for a single DP group. You can adjust the overall request traffic according to this.

Preemption cannot be avoided completely since KV cache usage always has a limit. But there are methods to reduce the chances of preemption. As is suggested in [**PREEMPTION**](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/configuration/optimization/#preemption), the core strategy is to increase available KV cache. For example, one can increase `--gpu-memory-utilization` or decrease `--max-num-seqs` && `--max-num-batched-tokens`.

### 23. How do I choose between single-node and multi-node deployment?

Single-node deployment is recommended when the model fits within the memory of a single node's NPUs. For models like Qwen3-32B (BF16), which requires 4 × 64GB cards, multi-NPU within a single node (TP) is sufficient. Multi-node deployment is only needed when the total NPU count exceeds a single node's capacity.

### 24. What quantization method should I use?

- **BF16**: Best accuracy, highest memory footprint. Use for accuracy-critical applications or when memory is sufficient.
- **W8A8**: Good balance of accuracy and memory reduction. Use for large models (e.g., 32B) on memory-constrained hardware.
- **W4A8/W4A4**: Maximum memory reduction. Suitable for deploying larger models on smaller hardware configurations, with some accuracy trade-off.

### 25. When should I enable FlashComm_v1?

Enable FlashComm_v1 (`VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_FLASHCOMM1=1`) when using Tensor Parallelism (TP ≥ 2) with high concurrency. It is threshold-protected and will not activate in low-concurrency scenarios where it could degrade performance.

### 26. What is the difference between FIA and PA operators for attention?

FIA (Flash Attention) is the default attention operator in vLLM-Ascend. In some batch-size settings (particularly medium concurrency), FIA may exhibit suboptimal performance. The PA (Page Attention) operator can be manually enabled via `pa_shape_list` in `--additional-config`. When the runtime batch size matches a value in `pa_shape_list`, the framework switches to PA. This is a temporary tuning knob — future FIA optimizations will make this parameter obsolete.
