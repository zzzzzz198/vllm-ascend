### Upgrade notice

- TorchNPU is upgraded to 2.7.1.post1. Please note that the package is pushed to [pypi mirror](https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/ascend/repos/pypi/torch-npu/). So it's hard to add it to auto dependence. Please install it by yourself.

- Qwen2-audio doesn't work by default. Temporary solution is to set `--gpu-memory-utilization` to a suitable value, such as 0.8.
- CPU bind feature doesn't work if more than one vLLM instance is running on the same node.
